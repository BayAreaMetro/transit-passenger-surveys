#Transit Passenger Survey Tableau Dashboards - 2024
##Overview
This Tableau workbook contains the dashboards and underlying worksheets for the Transit Passenger Survey Equity Dashboard, for the TPS administered between 2012 - 2019. 
It will eventually be merged with a post-COVID transit rider dataset to compare changes in ridership between the two periods.
