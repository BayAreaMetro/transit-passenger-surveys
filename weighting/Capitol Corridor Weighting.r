# Capitol Corridor Weighting.r
# SI

'#-------------------------------------------

This script creates weights for Capitol Corridor data collected by others (Corey, Canapary & Galanis).
The data file includes both weekend and weekday data, but the weekend data are set to zero and not weighted here.
We generally do not work with weighted weekend data, so there is likely no need to set a precedent here.

1. Average weekday ridership data from FY 2019 (~5,762 average daily passengers).
2. The 2019 annual distribution for station-to-station boardings comes from a FY 2019 matrix (both weekday/weekend) coming from Capital Corridor.
3. The ratio of weekday/yearly boardings is applied to #2 above to get average daily (proxy for average weekday) station-to-station riders.
4. The average daily ridership is divided by the number of surveys in each boarding-to-alighting pair to calculate the weight for that station-to station combination.
5. Station boardings with an unknown station within Oakland are assigned to Jack London and those unknown in Santa Clara were assigned to Great America (both based on higher likelihood).
6. A weighted average weight was applied to survey records missing a boarding and/or alighting station location.
7. All survey records weights are summed and compared to the average weekday ridership from #1, above. A correction factor is then applied to result in the precise total.
